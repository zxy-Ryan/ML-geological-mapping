# ML-geological-mapping

The field of geological mapping has long relied on traditional methods for the identification and classification of geological samples. However, with the increasing availability of geophysical and geochemical data, there is an opportunity to leverage machine learning techniques for improved efficiency and accuracy. In this project, I propose the use of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying geological samples based on their geophysical and geochemical attributes.

Our dataset is derived from airborne magnetic data and geochemical exploration data collected from a specific region in Northeast China. The attributes used for the classification model is the airborne magnetic data, while the target variable is the geochemical rock type classification of the sample points.

I have developed and trained a KNN model, which was subsequently applied to the target dataset. The model successfully classified the areas according to their geochemical rock type, enabling us to create a geological map of the target region. By employing this machine learning-based method, our approach has demonstrated greater accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional geological mapping techniques.
